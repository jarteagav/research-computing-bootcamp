The purpose of this two day (\~8 hour) bootcamp is to help PhD students streamline their research workflow, ensure their research is reproducible, and become familiar with new software tools. The course will help students to be more productive researchers and successfully complete computational projects in the second year ARE Ph.D.Â sequence.

We'll cover a mix of general topics as well and introduce some specific software tools not covered in first year coursework. The general topics include best practices of reproducible research, key software engineering ideas, and research workflows with collaboration. We'll provide short introductions to languages used for more intensive computation (MATLAB, Julia, Python) and help students get familiar with departmental resources. 

# Monday, Sep 23

## 1:00pm: Best practices in reproducible research (Agerton)

- Reproducible research
- Version control
- Project structure
- Data management

## 2:30pm: LaTeX & text editors (Agerton, Gafarov)

- Local editors: TeXworks, SublimeText 3, LyX
- collaborative editors: Overleaf (Bulat)

## 3:00pm: MATLAB/Python/Julia (Agerton, Gafarov, Beatty)

We'll discuss 

1. MATLAB
2. Python
3. Julia

For each language, the presenter will cover

- What he uses the language for
- How to install the language and any development environments needed
- Where to learn more about the language
- A sample workflow for an initial project

# Tuesday, Sep 24 -- NOTE REVISED TIMES

## 12:00pm Working with geospatial data (Hansen-Lewis)

- Topics
    + Storing / importing / exporting data
    + Shape vs raster
    + Projection
    + Merging spatial data w/ attributes
    + Spatial join
    + Reproducability by using Python/R interfaces
    + Software package: ArcGIS, QGIS, R

## 1:30pm: Programming best practices (Gafarov)

- Debugging and testing
- Writing readable code and OOP

## 3:00pm Linux and Accessing Dept resources (Erba)

- Department servers -- how to access & tools available
